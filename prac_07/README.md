## Introduction

Welcome to my practical exercises repository! My name is Juelai Li and I'm a student currently undertaking the subject 
CP1404. This repository contains all the practical exercises I have completed throughout the subject.

## Clean Code Lessons Learned

Throughout this subject, I have learned several important lessons about writing clean and maintainable code. Some of 
the main takeaways include:

- **Consistent Naming**: Using consistent and descriptive names for variables, functions, and classes improves code 
readability and understanding.
- **Modularity**: Breaking down code into smaller, modular components makes it easier to understand, test, and maintain.
- **Documentation**: Writing clear and concise documentation, including comments and docstrings, helps others 
(and your future self) understand the purpose and functionality of your code.
