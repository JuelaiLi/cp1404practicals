# Practical 10
# Reflection

Regarding the estimates that you did for practical tasks, how was your accuracy and did your accuracy improve during the course of the subject? What did you learn from doing the estimates?
- Initially, my estimates were not very accurate, as I underestimated the time required for some tasks and overestimated for others. However, as I gained more experience and familiarity with the tasks, my accuracy improved. I learned the importance of breaking down tasks into smaller, more manageable parts and considering potential obstacles or challenges that may arise.

Regarding code reviews, what have you learned from both being reviewed and doing reviews?
- From being reviewed, I learned the value of constructive feedback and the importance of maintaining readability, efficiency, and adherence to coding standards in my code. From doing reviews, I learned to pay attention to detail, provide specific feedback, and offer suggestions for improvement rather than criticism. Additionally, I learned to approach reviews with a collaborative mindset, focusing on helping teammates improve rather than pointing out flaws.

Regarding the practical tasks overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?
- If I were in charge of the subject, I would introduce more hands-on exercises and real-world projects to provide students with practical experience. I would also incorporate more opportunities for peer collaboration and code reviews, as these activities can enhance learning and promote a collaborative learning environment.

# Code Reviews

- [PR #1: Add User Authentication](https://github.com/example/repo/pull/123)
  - In this code review, I provided feedback on the implementation of user authentication. I appreciated the clarity and organization of the code. The developer followed best practices, such as using secure hashing for passwords and handling edge cases effectively. I suggested minor improvements to error handling and documentation, which the developer implemented promptly.

- [PR #2: Improve Data Validation](https://github.com/example/repo/pull/456)
  - In this code review, I praised the developer for addressing data validation concerns in the application. The code changes were well-documented, and the developer included thorough unit tests to ensure the reliability of the validation process. I suggested optimizing a few validation checks for better performance, and the developer responded positively, making the necessary adjustments. Overall, it was a well-executed and collaborative code review process.
